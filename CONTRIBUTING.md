### Developer Certificate of Origin

USpec requires the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process.
The developer need to add a `Signed-off-by` statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DCO1.1-2.txt](DCO1.1-2.txt).
You can add either **-s** or **--signoff** to your usual git commit commands.
If `Signed-off-by` is attached to the commit message, it is regarded as agreed to the [DCO1.1-2.txt](DCO1.1-2.txt)ï¼Ž
